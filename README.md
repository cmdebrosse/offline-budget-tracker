  <h1 align="center">Offline Budget Tracker</h1>

> **Created by Chuck DeBrosse**

## Description

This app allows users to keep an eye on their accounts whether an internet connection is available or not. Users can link an account and then add withdrawals and deposits as needed. In the event that the user is in a dead zone for service, Offline Budget Tracker will save all changes to an account and apply them to the users' balance when internet service is available again. Never have that "am I about to overdraw!?" mini-heartattack again!
